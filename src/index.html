    <h1>Analyse your motion-centric data set!</h1>
    <p>
      Do you have a data set which describes a very large number of movements between a small number of points?
      Perhaps you have a list of millions of flights or a collection of all train rides made in a city's metro system.
      Our system lets you visualise the movement from this dataset easily.
      Just upload your data set here or select from the list of existing data sets if you've already added your own.
    </p>
    <div>
      <select id="projects"></select>
      <button id="go">Go!</button>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Start new project</h2>
      <p>Want to upload a new dataset? Do so here. The dataset must be two bzip2 archives containing the two CSV files.
         One of them the movements file and have the columns</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>from</td><td>to</tr><td>A1</td><td>A2</td><td>A3</td><td>...</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        where A1, A2, A3, ... are the names of columns describing the movements.
        The order of the columns does not matter.
        The other CSV file must be the vertices file and have the columns
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Vertex</td><td>Latitude</tr><td>Longitude</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        The `Vertex` column lists the vertices' unique identifiers exactly as they would appear in the other file's `from` or `to` columns.
        The `Latitude` and `Longitude` columns must be numbers describing their locations (e.g. -70.4616 is OK and 70.4616 West is not allowed).
        Again, the order of the columns does not matter.
